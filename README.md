# mea_spineca_mapping
The mea-spineca-mapping is an easily adoptable analysis pipeline for paired dendritic spine calcium imaging with large-scale extracellular recording. 

Users can:
1. Reproduce the figures and results in "Inferring monosynaptic connections from paired dendritic spine Ca2+ imaging and large-scale recording of extracellular spiking". Data sets can be downloaded from https://gui.dandiarchive.org/#/dandiset/000223.
2. Adapt and implement the pipeline for their own data sets.
